# PimpMyString
PimpMyString is an iOS/OSX wrapper around NSAttributedStrong. It has the advantage of being strongly typed while NSStringAdditions are not.


## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- OSX 10.9

## Installation

### Carthage

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update

```

To integrate PimpMyString into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl

```

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

CocoaPods 0.36 adds supports for Swift and embedded frameworks. You can install it with the following command:

```

To add `PimpMyString` to your project, add this line to your  `Podfile` :

```ruby
pod 'PimpMyString', '~> 1.0.0'
```

### Manual
